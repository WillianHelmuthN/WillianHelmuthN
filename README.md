### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in a wide variety of things, including system development. I don't have a specific focus on which technology to study; I believe the most practical one for developing efficient solutions is ideal for the given context. Actually, I find it a bit tedious to study a variety of languages, which is why I have always been interested in the fundamentals of logic. I've always enjoyed mathematics and see a similarity there. Besides that, AI has been another focus of mine. In fact, this text was translated by an AI. I've learned not only how to use them efficiently but also how to manage them. Yes, I understand how an AI works behind the scenes, including the programming logic, multiple tables, graphs, and specific data that must be managed with extreme precision for it to function even minimally well. But don't worry, this text was only translated by an AI, not produced by one. Due to the need for AI adjustments, I ended up improving my text production and correction skills because, after all, you have to know how to teach AI...

I am learning a wide variety of topics, considerably broader than my main interests. These range from international issues such as current politics and global relations to the behavior of different fuels within a combustion chamber (yes, I also like mechanics). However, today I strive to balance topics of interest with subjects I need to study. An obvious example is improving my English so that I can produce a text without the help of an AI to translate it...

I seek to collaborate not with a specific project but with many current needs present in our reality. My dedication is focused on developing projects that not only help many people but also intelligently solve problems in society as a whole. This is reflected in my repositories, where you can find an organization of mine called E-jobs...

### Fun Facts

- I can understand English very well but have difficulties expressing myself.
- Because I like to study various subjects, I often have to delve into even more topics to understand them better or due to new doubts or curiosities...
