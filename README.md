### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Willian Helmuth**, and I'm interested in a wide variety of things, including system development. I believe in using the most practical technology for developing efficient solutions in any given context. My passion lies in the fundamentals of logic, and I've always enjoyed mathematics for its similarities.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is another focus of mine. This text was translated by an AI! I've learned how to use and manage AI effectively, understanding the programming logic, multiple tables, graphs, and specific data management required for it to function well. Rest assured, this text was only translated, not produced, by AI. This necessity led me to improve my text production and correction skills, as you need to know how to teach AI...

### What I'm Learning

I'm constantly exploring new topics, ranging from international politics and global relations to the behavior of different fuels in a combustion chamber (yes, I also like mechanics). Nowadays, I balance my interests with necessary studies, like improving my English to produce texts without AI assistance.

### Collaboration

I'm open to collaborating on various projects that address current needs in our reality. My dedication is towards developing projects that help many people and intelligently solve societal problems. Check out my organization, **E-jobs**, among my repositories.
